# otherwise, `b` is `False` and `c` is a sub-list of
# `cube` such that `c` is already unsatisfiable.

# in the derivation.
# In some cases, `c` will be simply the same as `cube`.
# But in various cases, the derivation did not
# rely on all literals of `cube`, and in such cases,
# only those literals that were relied on would be a
